                <h4>Hi, I'm Caleb! I'm an apsiring web developer currently studying at CoderAcademy!</h4>
                <p>
                    I've recently turned 23, and I have been infatuated with web development since I was in year 9, being roughly 15-16, 
                    but didn't have the opportunity in school to learn without the need for self-teaching. Which is why I'm at CoderAcademy 
                    so I can become properly qualified and confident in my technical ability. I hold a Diploma of Information Technology Networking, 
                    provided by TAFE Brisbane, which I graduated in 2018. However, web development is still my number one and no longer 
                    have the interest to persue this avenue of IT.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm an Assistant Manager at Domino's and have been for almost 4 years. It has been an incredible learning experience during
                    my time here, but I'm eager to move on and start a career in doing what I love and have always come back to. The skills I've learned
                    while being in my position would be highly beneficial to transfer over to my career. I have an excellent sense of 
                    brand empathy, have learned to work under pressure while managing my team for fast and effecient customer service, and providing
                    excellent customer service.
